Das Core 0.12.1
=====================

This is the official reference wallet for Das digital currency and comprises the backbone of the Das peer-to-peer network. You can [download Das Core](https://www.das.org/downloads/) or [build it yourself](#building) using the guides below.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Das on your native platform.

### Unix

You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Das-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install libqtgui4

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/das-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or bin/32/dasd (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/das-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or bin/64/dasd (headless, 64-bit)



### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run das-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Das-Core to your applications folder, and then run Das-Core.
